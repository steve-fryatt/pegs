<chapter title="Installing Solitaire" file="Install">

<cite>Solitaire</cite> requires RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3.1 or later, and can be run off a hard disc or floppy disc. To install <cite>Solitaire</cite> on a hard disc, copy the <file>!Solitaire</file> application to a suitable place on your disc.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Using Solitaire" file="Use">

<cite>Solitaire</cite> is a desktop version of the traditional game of the same name (known as &lsquo;Peg Solitaire&rsquo; in parts of the world where &lsquo;Solitaire&rsquo; refers to a card patience game). Load it on to the iconbar in the usual way and click <mouse>select</mouse> on its icon to open the game window.

To play, drag the pegs on the board around with <mouse>select</mouse>. A peg can be moved horizontally or vertically into an empty hole by jumping over exactly one hole containing a peg. The aim is to clear the board down to one remaining peg, ideally left in the centre hole which starts empty (although <cite>Solitaire</cite> won&rsquo;t give any special recognition to such a successful ending).

To re-fill the board, click <mouse>menu</mouse> over the main window and select <menu>New Board</menu>.

The <menu>Solid Drags</menu> option in the iconbar menu alternates between dragging sprites and dotted boxes; there is rarely any need to turn this option off.
